# Yu-Gi-Oh! The Sacred Cards — ROM Hack Project

This is a workspace for experimenting with ROM hacking.

## Folders
- **notes/** → Documentation, guides, struct layouts
- **scripts/** → Python helpers for patching/extracting
- **rom-original/** → Place your clean SacredCards.gba here
- **rom-hacked/** → Patched ROMs will be saved here
- **patch/** → Final .bps/.ips patches

## Tip
Always keep your clean ROM safe in `rom-original/` and work only on copies.
